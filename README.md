# Spectrum

A multiplayer web version of the social game "Wavelength".

* Players join a lobby
* One player is secretly shown a slider with a randomised position (from 0 to 100) and a card representing the two extremes (e.g. "Cold â†” Hot")
* That player then picks a single word that they think best represents the slider's position (e.g. if the position was 10%, the player might enter the word "Ice")
* The other players then try to guess where on the slider that word represents
* The closer they get to the correct position, the more points they score.
* Play then passes to the next player.
